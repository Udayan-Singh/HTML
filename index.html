    <h2>I'm Also Planning a Vacation</h2>
    <p>I've been working hard and I want to get out of this
        monotonous schedule of mine.
    </p>
    <p>I live in Bhopal and I want to visit a beach.</p>

    <h3>Place I'd Like to Visit</h3>
    <p>I've always wanted to go to <strong>Brazil</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Place I'd Want To Avoid</h3>
    <p>I really can't think of any place I'd not want to visit once if I
        had the chance.
